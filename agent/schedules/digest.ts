// Nitro scheduled task for the morning digest. Unlike the memory-* schedules this one has
// no systemd predecessor — scripts/daily-digest.ts was always command-only (/digest), and a
// surprise unsolicited morning message is not acceptable, so this fires OFF by default: it
// reads data/settings.json at fire time (not at discovery/compile time, so a toggle flip
// applies on the very next tick without a restart) and returns immediately unless
// digestSchedule.enabled is explicitly true. No lockPath: the digest doesn't touch
// vault/CORE.md or MOC.md, so it doesn't need to serialize with the memory rollups.
