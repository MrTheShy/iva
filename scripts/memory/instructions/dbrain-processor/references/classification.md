# Classification — what becomes a card

Decide per noteworthy item. When unsure, prefer **fewer, richer** cards over many thin
ones. Most transcript lines stay in the transcript and never become cards.

## Map content → type

| Signal in the transcript                                              | type       | folder             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| A person/org that will recur ("met X", "from company Y")              | `contact`  | `cards/contacts/`  |
| Ongoing effort with deliverables ("working on Z", "the X project")    | `project`  | `cards/projects/`  |
| A choice made + reason ("decided to…", "going with… because…")        | `decision` | `cards/decisions/` |
| A proposal/hypothesis worth revisiting ("what if…", "idea:")          | `idea`     | `cards/ideas/`     |
| A durable fact / learning / reference ("turns out…", "TIL", a how-to) | `note`     | `cards/notes/`     |

## Stays in the transcript (do NOT card)

- Logistics, scheduling, acknowledgements, transient status.
- One-off questions already answered inline by Iva with no lasting fact.
- Emotional venting with no decision/idea/fact to keep.
- Anything already represented by an existing card → **update** that card instead.

## Topics (for the daily-summary)

Topics are 2–6 short labels describing what the day was _about_ — broader than tags,
narrower than domains. Examples: `iva-memory`, `deepgram`, `vault-schema`, `family`,
`reading`. They populate the summary's `## Topics` and `topics:` frontmatter and are the
primary way weekly/monthly/yearly rollups understand the period.

## Decision vs. idea vs. note

- **decision** — irreversible-ish, has a rationale, can later be `superseded`/`reverted`.
- **idea** — not yet acted on; status `active` → `explored` → `archived`.
- **note** — a fact/learning with no action attached.

## Update vs. create

Update an existing card when the new info is the _same subject_. Signs you should update:
same person, same project, same decision being refined. Append a dated line under a
`## Log` section and sharpen the `description`. Creating a near-duplicate is the most
common mistake — grep first.

## ADD / UPDATE / SUPERSEDE / RETRACT / NOOP (temporal conflict)

For every fact, pick one operation:

- **ADD** — genuinely new subject → create a card (prefer the `write_card` tool; it enforces
  the schema so you can't invent a type or field).
- **UPDATE** — existing subject, new fact compatible with current truth → add it to
  the card's single dated `## Log`. UPDATE never creates a card and never carries a
  contradictory former/current pair.
- **NOOP** — already captured and unchanged → do nothing.
- **SUPERSEDE** — the new fact _contradicts_ a current value on an existing card (job changed,
  moved city, status flipped). Do NOT just append: **rewrite** the card's current value
  (frontmatter field + top of the description) to the new fact — this is "Compiled Truth", the
  living snapshot of what is true _now_ — and move the OLD value to a `## History` section as a
  dated line: `- 2026-03→06: TDI Group`. History is append-only and never edited.
  **Never leave two contradictory current values on the same subject.**
  If a whole card is obsolete (project renamed, decision reverted), set `status: superseded`
  and add `superseded_by: [[new-card]]`.
- **RETRACT** — the old value **was never true**: you misheard, mis-linked, or inferred wrong.
  This is _not_ SUPERSEDE. Superseding writes `- 2026-03→06: TDI Group` into `## History`,
  which asserts the fact held during that window — archiving a falsehood as if it were a
  past truth. Instead: correct the current value as usual, and record the removal under a
  `## Retracted` section with the date you found out and why:

  ```markdown
  ## Retracted

  - 2026-08-05: "works at TDI Group" — never true, confused with another contact (was INFERRED)
  ```

  If the whole card is bogus, set `status: retracted` rather than `archived` — archived means
  "no longer relevant", retracted means "should not have been written".

  **Why the distinction is load-bearing:** `## History` is what the model reads back as the
  subject's past. A wrong inference filed there becomes a fact, gets summarized into the
  weekly rollup, and by the monthly one nobody can tell it came from a guess. Retractions
  also concentrate: a card with three of them is telling you its source is unreliable, which
  is information no `## History` line will ever give you.

  Pairs with `confidence:` — an INFERRED value that turns out wrong is the ordinary case for
  RETRACT, and an EXTRACTED one turning out wrong is worth a second look at the transcript.

The deterministic scan `.graph/supersede-candidates.json` lists same-entity cards with
conflicting fields — resolve each by superseding the stale one.

The mechanical report `.graph/enforce-report.json` may list `compile_candidates`
whose duplicate Related sections contain prose. Reread and repair those cards
semantically on the next dbrain pass; deterministic cleanup will not discard prose.

## Confidence

Tag each fact's certainty in frontmatter with `confidence:`:

- **EXTRACTED** — the user stated it directly (assert it when recalling).
- **INFERRED** — you deduced it (hedge when recalling: "похоже, ты…").
- **AMBIGUOUS** — unclear/conflicting source (flag it).
