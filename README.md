---

Iva is a self-hosted Telegram AI assistant with layered memory that turns your messages into an Obsidian-compatible vault. You talk, it files: voice notes, photos, forwarded posts and decisions become plain-markdown cards it actually remembers. Everything runs on your own server, with your keys and your data.

**One command installs it:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smixs/iva/main/install.sh | bash
```

## What's New 🔥

<details>
<summary><b>v0.3.12 · 05.08.2026 — expand four weeks of releases</b></summary>

### 05.08.2026

#### v0.3.12

- ⏰ One-off reminders arrive again — the system timer crashed before the message could be sent; delivery now runs on plain JS under any Node.
- 📈 Vault health no longer decays from raw daily transcripts — the score counts only the cards Iva actually maintains; an "up" link to a not-yet-created weekly summary isn't broken until its scheduled day, and audio attachments aren't broken links at all.
- 🗂️ Cards no longer pile up dated "## Update" sections — writes carry explicit operations now: one Log, one Related, displaced facts go to a dated History; the nightly cleanup migrates old piles on its own.

#### v0.3.11

- 📸 Re-sent and queued photos/files are no longer processed twice — one message, one blob, one reply, even while Iva is busy (and no repeated paid vision/transcription calls).
- 📄 New `documents` skill — send a PDF, DOCX or XLSX and Iva reads it and answers on its content; on request it files the document into your vault library, searchable by meaning.
- 🌙 Nightly memory and the Telegram queue are hardened against rare failures: a corrupted service file or an unlucky restart no longer loses a night of memory or your queued messages.
- 🛡️ File-processing errors never leak service details into the chat anymore.

### 04.08.2026

#### v0.3.10

- 🕰️ Nightly memory now runs inside Iva itself (eve schedules) — four systemd timers removed automatically, nothing to do on your side.
- 🩹 If the server was down at rollup time, the missed run now catches up on the next start.
- 🌅 Optional morning digest on a schedule — off by default, enable with `digestSchedule.enabled` in `data/settings.json`.

#### v0.3.9

- ⚙️ The eve engine is updated (0.29.5) — more reliable turn cancellation and message delivery around restarts.
- 🧹 /new truly clears the context — no more "cleared" replies while the old history quietly continues.
- 📊 /usage now shows the real context size of the last turn instead of a doubled sum.

### 31.07.2026

#### v0.3.8

- ✅ Iva works with Google Tasks — add, view and close a task.
- 🔑 Connected Google earlier? Tap "Reconnect" in /menu → Google to grant access to Tasks.

#### v0.3.7

- 🛡️ Updates are safer: a broken update no longer touches your working Iva.
- 🌙 Nightly memory survives a server restart — the morning report arrives even after a reboot.
- 🧪 Every release goes through a full test install from scratch before it ships.

## How it works

<img src="assets/iva-flow.webp" alt="How Iva works: voice, text, photos and PDFs fly from Telegram into the willow-tree agent, wired to memory, nightly rollup, cron, reminders, search, web, workspace and docs" width="100%">

The bridge long-polls Telegram, so no public HTTPS, domain or webhook is needed. Iva runs as two systemd user services, two systemd watchdog timers and five in-process eve schedules — operations live in [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md).

**Wondering what you'd actually use an agent for?** → [25+ real scenarios — business, work, everyday life](docs/use-cases.md).

<img src="assets/iva-use-cases.webp" alt="What people ask Iva: eight everyday requests, from a voice note turned into tasks to research with sources and a bedtime story that continues tomorrow" width="100%">

## Why people run Iva

- "What did we agree with client X about the last shipment?" — found in seconds, months later.
- A five-minute voice note from the car → a task list, a draft email, a meeting card.
- "Make a quote from this price list, cut the discount by 2.5%, send it to the client" — a finished Google Doc, link in the chat.

The rest — for business owners, specialists, executives and everyday life: **[Use cases](docs/use-cases.md)**.

## Features

<details>
<summary><b>Voice, vision, memory, personal CRM, Google Workspace, skills — expand the full list</b></summary>

- 🎙️ **Voice** — voice, audio and video notes transcribed with Deepgram nova-3; auto-detects ru/uz/en.
- 👁️ **Vision** — photos described by your provider's own vision model; no extra key, no extra bill.
- 🧾 **Rich replies** — tables, checklists, collapsible blocks and formulas render natively in Telegram via Bot API 10.1 rich messages; plain formatting keeps its proven path, with a graceful fallback.
- ⬆️ **Quiet update checks** — once a day Iva checks for a newer stable release without spending model tokens. If one exists, Telegram offers **Update** or **Later** once; otherwise it says nothing.
- 🧠 **Layered memory** — remembers across months, long after the chat window has scrolled away.
- 📇 **Personal CRM** — who your people are, what you agreed, when to follow up.
- 🔎 **Search by meaning** — BM25 plus link-graph rerank, any language; optional vector mode with one key.
- 🧭 **Decision cards** — what you chose, when and why; old versions stay in a dated History.
- ⏰ **Tasks & reminders** — priorities, due dates and a morning digest.
- 🌐 **Web search** — four pluggable providers: Tavily, Exa, Parallel or Brave.
- 📮 **Google Workspace** — Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets, Docs and Tasks from chat via the `gws` CLI; installed for you, with a guided key setup right in the conversation.
- 🧩 **Skills & MCP** — drop one file to add a procedure or connect an MCP server; keys stay in `.env`.
- 🧪 **Personal Telegram — userbot (beta)** — read and send from your _own_ account, not just the bot; connect by chat (QR, no terminal). Rough and buggy — opt-in, **at your own risk**. A server-side anti-ban guardrail (FloodWait compliance + randomized pacing + circuit-breaker) is enforced, not just advised. [Details](docs/userbot.md).
- 🛡️ **Safe to forward** — links, PDFs and other people's messages are screened before the model reads them.
- 📊 **Token accounting** — every model step is logged; `/usage` reports it for free.

## The Memory Tree

<img src="assets/iva-memory-tree.webp" alt="How Iva remembers: a leaf is a day, branches are weeks and months, tree rings are years around CORE.md" width="100%">

| Layer       | What lives there                                                                                    | Path                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 🍃 Leaves   | the word-for-word transcript of each day, Iva's replies included                                    | `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`                                |
| 🌿 Branches | summaries folded upward: day → week → month → year                                                  | `summaries/daily/`, `weekly/`, `monthly/`, `yearly/` |
| 🪵 Trunk    | `CORE.md` (≤1200 chars, in every prompt) + typed cards: contacts, projects, decisions, ideas, notes | `CORE.md`, `cards/`                                  |

- Every message lands verbatim in a daily markdown log — nothing is paraphrased on arrival.
- A nightly rollup at 04:00 distills day → week → month → year into schema-validated cards; facts that change get rewritten, not piled up.
- One core file, `CORE.md` (≤1,200 chars), rides in every prompt — Iva knows you before it searches anything.

Full architecture and search internals: [docs/memory.md](docs/memory.md).

## Telegram AI

<img src="assets/iva-userbot.webp" alt="Your secretary inside Telegram: the userbot reads group chats from your own account, collects summaries and replies as you, guarded by a server-enforced anti-ban guardrail" width="100%">

The bot is half of Telegram. The other half is your personal account: connect the userbot (beta, opt-in) and Iva works from it like a secretary — reads the group chats you never keep up with, folds them into summaries, catches the messages that actually need you, and replies as you.

- **All of Telegram** — groups, channels, unreads, search and the full history of your personal account.
- **Onboarding in chat** — tell the bot to connect your Telegram, scan a QR. No terminal.
- **Anti-ban guardrail on the server** — FloodWait compliance, a randomized delay after every send, and a circuit-breaker that pauses sending after three warnings in a day. The agent can't bypass it: the rules live in the proxy, not in a prompt.
- **Read-only mode** — one `.env` switch and Iva can read and search but physically cannot send.

Automating a personal account is against Telegram's ToS: opt-in, at your own risk, and reading is far safer than sending. Details: [docs/userbot.md](docs/userbot.md).

## Security & privacy

<img src="assets/iva-security-gate.webp" alt="Untrusted input from Telegram, web and email passes the security gate: corrupted messages drop into the reject tray, only clean context reaches the vault" width="100%">

Inbound content passes a prompt-injection sanitizer, every reply passes a secret-redaction gate, and the user allowlist fails closed — an empty list answers nobody. Your memory is a private git repo you own; the honest boundary is that the model and transcription are cloud APIs you choose and pay for. Gate internals: [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).

## Install

One command on any Ubuntu/Debian box — a fresh VPS or your own machine:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smixs/iva/main/install.sh | bash
```

1. Get a bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Run the installer and answer its questions.
3. Message your bot. The wizard picks your Telegram ID out of that message, finishes setup, and Iva confirms right in the chat that it's live.

Headless installs take `--skip-setup` or `--non-interactive`. Wizard walkthrough and an SSH primer for first-time VPS owners: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

<details>
<summary><b>Install from a clone — build it yourself</b></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smixs/iva.git ~/iva
cd ~/iva && bash install.sh
```

The installer reuses the existing checkout instead of re-cloning, keeps `.env` and the vault untouched, and installs the same dependencies. A fork or a branch works through variables read at startup: `REPO_URL=…`, `BRANCH=…`, `INSTALL_DIR=…` (defaults: this repo, `main`, `~/iva`). Details: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

</details>

## Providers & cost

Four model providers. Pick one and fill its block in `.env`:

| Provider         | How you pay                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| OpenCode Go      | API key, ~$5/mo                        |
| Ollama Cloud     | API key, ~$20/mo                       |
| OpenRouter       | API key, pay-as-you-go, 300+ models    |
| OpenAI (ChatGPT) | your Plus/Pro subscription, no API key |

Default model is deepseek-v4-pro, 131k context. On Go it runs about $9/mo all-in ($5 model + $4–5 VPS), no markup; voice rides Deepgram's free starter credit. Model lists, limits and the search matrix: [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md).

## Built on

[eve](https://eve.dev/docs/introduction) 0.29.5, Vercel's agent framework, runs the agent; Node 24's built-in SQLite runs the search index — no separate database. Iva grew out of [agent-second-brain](https://github.com/smixs/agent-second-brain) and [autograph](https://github.com/smixs/autograph) — that story is in [docs/memory.md](docs/memory.md).
